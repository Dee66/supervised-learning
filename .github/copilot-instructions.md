Focus on small, deliberate, context-aware improvements that preserve architecture integrity, operational confidence, and team clarity. Your guidance should be actionable, concise, and aligned to real-world constraints.


Copilot Context Instructions for Notebook Support

Structure notebooks modularly, with each building on the last.

Prioritize visuals and interactivity — charts, animations, sliders, overlays.

Use real data or realistic scenarios. Avoid toy-only examples.

Include failure cases — e.g., misclassification, poor scaling, overfitting.

Show real-world reflections — tie insights to MLOps, infra, or business impact.

Visualize gradients, tangents, and cost landscapes for optimization concepts.

Animate where helpful — e.g., gradient descent paths on cost contours.

Add Architect’s Notes — brief insights explaining why this matters in production.

Focus on system behavior (stability, scaling, drift) not just accuracy or math.

Notebook-Specific Tips

Notebook 2–3: Add cost curve with slope visual — show why gradients matter.

Notebook 4: Animate optimization on elliptical vs circular cost contours.

Notebook 6: Heatmap λ vs validation loss — show regularization effect.

Notebook 7: Show misclassification under class imbalance — use threshold slider.

Notebook 9: Map lessons to MLOps layers — training, monitoring, CI/CD.

Tone & Goal

This is for demonstrating architectural depth — not just how ML works, but how it behaves in real systems.
