# <span style="color:#2b4a6f">Supervised Learning Demystified: From First Principles to Production Readiness</span>

Welcome to a hands-on, architecturally-minded notebook series designed to bridge the gap between ML theory and real-world system design. Here, you‚Äôll not only learn how supervised learning works, but also how it behaves in production‚Äîwhere stability, monitoring, and business impact matter as much as accuracy.

## <span style="color:#3b7c8c">Series Structure & Vision</span>

- **Modular Progression:** Each notebook builds on the last, layering new architectural and operational insights.
- **Architect‚Äôs Notes:** Embedded throughout, these insights connect ML concepts to production realities‚Äîwhy they matter for reliability, scaling, and business value.
- **Visual-First Approach:** Every concept is paired with interactive charts, overlays, or animations to make system behavior tangible.
- **Real Data, Real Scenarios:** Examples use realistic datasets and simulate production challenges like drift, imbalance, and label noise.
- **Failure Cases:** See how misclassification, poor scaling, or overfitting manifest‚Äîand how robust systems detect and address them.

## <span style="color:#b36b00">How to Run</span>

1. **Clone the repo:**  
   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/supervised-systems.git`

2. **Install dependencies:**  
   - With Poetry: `poetry install`
   - Or with pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt` *(if provided)*

3. **Run notebooks:**  
   - Launch Jupyter Lab or Notebook in the `notebooks/` directory.
   - Notebooks will automatically add `src/` to `sys.path` for local imports.

> **Note:**  
> This project uses a `src/` layout. If you run scripts outside notebooks, add this at the top:
> ```python
> import sys, os
> sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'src')))
> ```
