# 00 – Core API Demo

🟩 **GOOD:** This notebook demonstrates the core API integration for CodeCraft AI, following Clean Architecture and AWS-native best practices.

## Purpose

- Showcase end-to-end interaction with the deployed AI API (FastAPI/SageMaker endpoint)
- Provide a reproducible, production-aligned demo for stakeholders and technical reviewers
- Serve as a baseline for further prompt engineering, evaluation, and integration notebooks

> 🟦 **NOTE:** Ensure your API endpoint is running and accessible before executing these cells.

```python
# 🟪 ARCH: Environment-aware configuration, no hardcoded secrets
import os
import requests

API_URL = os.getenv("CODECRAFT_API_URL", "http://localhost:8000/query")
API_AUTH_TOKEN = os.getenv("CODECRAFT_API_TOKEN", "")
API_AUTH_HEADER = os.getenv("CODECRAFT_API_AUTH_HEADER", "Authorization")
API_AUTH_PREFIX = os.getenv("CODECRAFT_API_AUTH_PREFIX", "Bearer")

def ask_ai(query: str, top_k: int = 3, extra_payload: dict = None):
    payload = {"query": query, "top_k": top_k}
    if extra_payload:
        payload.update(extra_payload)
    headers = {}
    if API_AUTH_TOKEN:
        if API_AUTH_PREFIX:
            headers[API_AUTH_HEADER] = f"{API_AUTH_PREFIX} {API_AUTH_TOKEN}"
        else:
            headers[API_AUTH_HEADER] = API_AUTH_TOKEN
    try:
        response = requests.post(API_URL, json=payload, headers=headers, timeout=30)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"🟥 CRITICAL: API error: {e}")
        return None
```

## Example: Ask a Question

```python
from pprint import pprint

question = "What is CodeCraft AI?"
result = ask_ai(question)
pprint(result)
```

## Try Your Own Question

```python
my_question = "How does the vector store work?"
my_result = ask_ai(my_question)
pprint(my_result)
```
